(1) it has a vector space model trained on multiple corpus that assigns each word a six-dimensional vector, representing Ekman’s six basic emotions: anger, sadness, joy, surprise, disgust, and fear.

Given 15 conflict stories to compare, when the program uses Genesis discovered concept patterns and vector matching, its result best predicts human results."
