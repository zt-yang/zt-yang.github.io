						<p> Using the Genesis system as a substrate, story-understanding goes beyond generating binary classification or relying on combinations of keywords. Instead, we carry out a full, systematic interpretation of the story elements and we are able to explain every step. </p>

								<!-- Then, using Fay’s structural alignment work, Krakauer compares patterns generated
	across stories by finding and then comparing their alignment structures. This method of
	comparison is vital for distinguishing between patterns that share events but not structure.
	For instance, Krakauer gives the example of “Mary hits Sally leads to Sally hits Mary leads
	to Mary yells at Sally” as being fundamentally dissimilar to “Mary hits Sally and Mary
	yells at Sally leads to Sally hits Mary.”
	Krakauer also performs word-based generalizations to extract higher-level concept pattern. For instance, the concept of “revenge” is characterized by the pattern, “A harming
	B leads to B harming A,” but “harming” includes an assortment of actions ranging from
	“kick” to “kill.” Using the semantic hierarchy of WordNet, Krakauer calculates a “thread
	distance” to determine if two concept patterns express the same idea despite using different
	vocabulary.

It uses two methods to measure similarity: (1) Vector Angle, which calculates the similarity between vectors of concept patterns (order doesn't matter); (2) In-Order comparison, which is the ratio of the aligned patterns to the total number of patterns. Given 15 conflict stories to compare, when the program uses Genesis discovered concept patterns and vector matching, its result best predicts human results.</td>

The story alignment program is used to fill in missing gaps in descriptions of videos by comparing the video to an existing video corpus.</td>
