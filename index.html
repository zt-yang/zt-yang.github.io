						<!-- <h3>About</h3> -->
						<p>We believe human intelligence differs from that of other primates, past and present, because we humans understand, tell, and compose stories, and because we are able to direct our perceptual faculties to describe, and answer questions about, real and imagined situations. It follows that if we are to develop a full account of human intelligence, we must develop computational models of our human story competence and directed perception faculties.</p>
						<p>Our vision is explained in more detail in a <a href="https://groups.csail.mit.edu/genesis/trilogy.html">trilogy</a> of papers, a <a href="https://groups.csail.mit.edu/genesis/various.html">white paper on story understanding</a>, and a paper on <a href="https://groups.csail.mit.edu/genesis/various.html">story summarization</a>.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="ym-g75 ym-gr">
					<div class="ym-gbox-right">

						<h3>Steps</h3>
						<p>Believing that system building forces rigor and motivates, we of CSAIL's Genesis Group have built and continue to empower the Genesis System, a system that understands, tells, and composes stories using common sense rules and higher level concept patterns.</p>
						<p>Genesis has been brought to a level where Genesis exhibits many aspects of human story processing and directed perception, such as listener-aware instructive story telling, persuasive story telling, precedent-based story composition, story summarizing, question answering, attention to personality and mood, attention to culturally grounded differences in interpretation, question-driven reflection, anticipation of potential harm, and understanding on multiple levels.</p>
						<p>We hammer out our ideas on an anvil of manually prepared stories, common sense rules, and concept patterns, all expressed in simple English, along with annotated video, with annotations also expressed in simple English. Genesis reads stories ranging from 100 sentence summaries of Shakespeare's plots to conflict in cyberspace to Crow creation myths to stories used in psychological studies.</p>

						<h3>Challenges</h3>
						<p>Our biggest challenge is to scale up our illustrations-of-concept Genesis System such that the common sense rules and concept patterns are learned, the stories are real, albeit simple, and the video is not annotated, albeit also simple. We believe that scaling up will make our Genesis System sufficiently powerful that we will be able to perform experiments that determine how well our models explain and predict human behavior.</p>

						<h3>Contributions</h3>
						<p>We believe that when we scale up and do the science required to understand human-level story competence, many undreamed-of applications will emerge. One of many exciting possibilities we have dreamed of already is the construction of tools for policy analysts that will be as useful to them as spreadsheets are to financial analysts.</p>

						<h3>History</h3>
						<p>The roots of the Genesis Group lie in the thinking that led to the thoughts of a group that styled itself as <a href="http://genesis.csail.mit.edu/HIE/index.html">The Human Intelligence Enterprise</a>.</p>

							<h5>Story Understanding</h5>
							<div class="tab-content">
								<p> The Genesis group believes that story understanding is essential to artificial general intelligence. The “story” here broadly refers to any related sequence of events; a traditional narrative structure is not necessary.</p>
								<p> Using Genesis system as a substrate, story-understanding goes beyond generating binary classification or relying on combinations of keywords. Instead, we carry out a full, systematic interpretation of the story elements and we are able to explain every step. </p>

							<h5>Story representation</h5>
							<div class="tab-content">
								<p>Genesis translates English into an inner language consisting of a variety of representations, ranging from physical events to emotional responses. First, Genesis examines descriptions of physical movement, then abstract movement in political space, then a test suite that engages all of the representations.</p>
								<video controls="controls" width="600">

							</div>

							<h5>Story understanding</h5>
							<div class="tab-content">
								<p>Genesis analyzes a simple twenty-line description of the plot in Macbeth. White boxes represent explicit statements in the plot description; gray boxes are common-sense conclusions. Once the common-sense conclusions are in place, Genesis searches the elaboration graph for higher-level concepts such as revenge and insane violence, thus reflecting a bias on the left toward an asian understanding of the story and on the right toward a western understanding.</p>

							<h5>Story telling</h5>
							<div class="tab-content">
								<p>Genesis tells the Macbeth story to an uneducated student who is presumed to have no common sense at all. In the first telling, Genesis spoon feeds the student, supplying conclusions the student cannot reach. In the second telling, Genesis provides explanations. In the third, Genesis helpfully supplies common-sense rules by which the conclusions are reached, so that the student can reach independant conclusions.</p>

							<h5>Story comparison</h5>
							<div class="tab-content">
								<p>Genesis compares fifteen conflict stories two ways: on the top, the green boxes mean strong similarity at the concept level; on the bottom, the green boxes mean strong similarity at the word level. Stories are always similar to themselves, so the diagonal is green. Note that some stories can be strongly similar at a concept level, but not the word level, and vice versa.</p>

His research is focused on building and studying intelligent computing systems that demonstrate a human-like capability for in-depth understanding and production of natural language, and thus can achieve richer interactions with human users. He is especially keen on building systems that decompose the meaning of language into complex conceptual structures that reflect humans' embodied cognition, memory, imagery, and knowledge about social situations. He uses crowdsourcing and machine learning techniques to build these systems to scale, but he also often crafts systems by hand because it can tell us how to use crowds and machine learning methods better.</p>

He was professor at MIT for almost 50 years, Winston was director of MIT’s Artificial Intelligence Laboratory from 1972 to 1997 before it merged with the Laboratory for Computer Science to become MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL).</p>

						<h3>Install Genesis Demo App</h3>
						<p>You can download the demonstrations of the Genesis Group's story-understanding system.</p>

						<div class="jquery_tabs">

							<div class="tab-content">
								<p>Some of the story-understanding functionality of Genesis is now available via the Java WebStart mechanism, which comes with the Java Runtime Environment, the so-called JRE. So, if you don't have the Java 8 Runtime Enviornment installed, you should <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html">install Java RE 8</a> first.</p>

								<p>Next, because Java security becomes steadily greater, you will need to do some <a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/genesis/preparation.html">preparation</a>.</p>
							</div>

							<h5>Step 2: Download Genesis</h5>
							<div class="tab-content">
								<p>Then, you can run <a href="https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.034f/genesis/genesis.jnlp">Genesis</a>. It will likely take a while to download, as it is about 30MB, because it contains some big dictionary files. Web Start will ask if you trust us. Indicate that you do. Then Web Start will download Genesis onto your computer. You will see something like the following:</p>
