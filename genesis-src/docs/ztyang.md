## The Mental Emulator

Someone jump to conclusions very soon. Someone always asks "how" and "why". No particular ways to think is the best. But some are better to use for effective communication and building rapport with another person.

Imagine someone is having a conversation with Genesis. If Genesis can detect his thinking patterns early on in the conversation and emulate his ways to think, as opposed to sticking to Genesis' default ways to think, then Genesis can communicate more effectively with the person and build rapport faster.

The Mental Emulator should be one kind of Social Emulators. The other Social Emulators include postures, words choices, accents, facial expressions, and many other surface features. Although all Social Emulators makes it easier to build rapport, the Mental Emulator probably does it in the deepest level because it's so much easier to think if the other person understands and thinks along your direction. The Mental Emulator is hardest to detect because people usually stick to their own ways to think. 



## The Negative Reinforcer

Imagine you usually lock your blue bike next to your office building. One day, you were trying to lock your bike, and you accidentally knocked down the black bike next to you. That's because the owner of the black bike placed the bike too close to the other spot, which you were using. You helped the black bike stand still. You were afraid that the fall would have left scratches on the black bike, which would annoy the owner. Luckily that didn't happen.

What happened was that whenever you lock your bike again, you try to place your bike as close to your spot as possible. You think, in that way the others will not knock down your bike and leave a scratch on it, which would annoy you.

You wouldn't have planned this step to prevent damage if you haven't been in the role of causing damage.

Here are more stories of learning from negative examples:

* After teaching a class full of naughty students, you knew how to be a better student looking at her and respond anything to her questions.
* After listening to a useless lecture, you knew how to be a better teacher by telling the students what they will learn and how they can apply.

Here is the possible mechanism behind the Negative Reinforcer (NR):

* NR has several life principles or likes, each of which is a concept pattern, such as:
    * Don't annoy other people
    * I don't like to be annoyed
* NR detects the patterns in stories and find out the actions that lead to the principles being violated. such as:
    * The owner may be annoyed because I have left a scratch on his car because I knocked down his bike because his bike gets in the way for me the lock my bike.
* Identify the actions that can prevent the causes from happening:
    * Be careful when placing my bike into clusters of other bikes so that others will not be annoyed
    * Don't place my bike in a way that might get in the ways of others so that I will not be annoyed
* Either update in our procedures to do things or build checker programs to respond to triggers of its potential happening.
    * Have a checker to solve "if my actions will knock down other's bikes"
    * Have a checker to solve "if my bike placed properly"
    * Optionally include these two checkers (including the steps to fix the situation) into procedures to lock bikes.
* Generalize to other tasks and domains.
* Reinforce beliefs


## Principle Builders

Where do life principles come from? Here are several possible ways to acquire them:

* Reinforced: adherence to the principle is rewarded while violation is punished
* Remembered: someone important to Genesis told it to do so
* Derived: derived from likes, wants, goals, existing principles, and commonsense, for example:
    * A: I don't like to be annoyed
    * B: Treat others the way you want to be treated
    * C = A x B: Don't annoy other people
    ----
    * D: I want to be liked by people
    * E: If I annoy someone, he wouldn't like me.
    * F = D x E: Don't annoy other people


## Preference Builders

Where do likes come from? Here are several possible ways to acquire them:

* Derived from value:
    * A: I value time
    * B: Being annoyed takes away my time
    * C = A x B: I don't like to be annoyed
* Derived from biological/computational limitations:
    * D: I must not crash
    * E: I will crash when I feel stressed/overloaded by the negative implications of a current or future event (measured by the amount of search)
    * F: Being asked to be his girlfriend stressed me out
    * G = D x E: I don't like to be stressed out
    * H = F x G: I don't like to be asked to be his girlfriend


## Value Builders

Where do values come from? Here are several possible ways to acquire them:

* Derived from goals:
    * A: I must get good grades in school
    * B: If I want to get good grades, I need to study hard
    * C: If I want to study hard, I need to use a lot of time
    * D: If I don't value time, I don't have a lot of time to use
    * E = D x C x B x A: I must value time.

And then this belief is used without much inspection in other domains too.

And then you could ask where do goals come from ... we go into loops.



## Identity Builders

Let's name all these likes, wants, values, principles as one's identity. It subjective beliefs about what one should be/do. I hypothesize that our the beliefs in our identity are built up from shaky derivations from one another. The ultimate source is:

* Remembered: what we think the people important to us want us to be/do
* Reinforced: without major system crash to question the validity of existing identity

Speaking of "subjective," how objective can we be about other beliefs. We may believe in:

* Apples are good for health
* If one wants to make a difference, he must be rich first

I hypothesize that our objective beliefs come from repetition of nearby sources, such as the books, the media, our teachers, our family ... So objectivity may just be collective subjectivity.



## Belief Builders

So without all these Principle Builders, Preference Builders, Value Builders, Goal Builders, and Identity Builders, we will only have Belief Builders.

Think about the ways we categorize subjective beliefs into likes, wants, values, and principles. Do we actually learn the way to categorize them after we had the beliefs and used the beliefs. Look at how easy it is to categorize them by the verb, "like," "want," "value," and "do/don't." Maybe their categorization is the artifact of language and less useful for our reasoning.

So I will just create a Belief Builder to remember the beliefs imparted by other sources and reinforced though Genesis' experience.
